<h1>Damian's Top 3 movies of the recent years</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies this decade (so far)</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>A really artistic movie with a very interesting twist that questions comic book movies as a medium in a very clever way.</p>

<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>A dark, grounded Batman movie with a very convincing Robert Pattinson as the Dark Knight.</p>

<h3>Soul</h3>
<p>This movie is a must watch for every person of every age, but especially recommended to people that like to ask the big questions about life.</p>
